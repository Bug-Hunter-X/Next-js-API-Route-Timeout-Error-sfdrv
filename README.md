# Next.js API Route Timeout Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js API routes where the request takes longer than the default server timeout, resulting in an error.

## Problem

Next.js API routes have a default timeout that prevents them from running indefinitely. If a request to an API route takes longer than this timeout, Next.js will return an error to the client. In the `data.js` file, a 5-second delay is intentionally introduced.  Without proper handling, this will trigger a timeout on many deployments.

## Solution

The solution involves configuring the timeout within the Next.js server or appropriately handling long-running requests, perhaps by using background workers or webhooks to notify the client on completion instead of a synchronous API response.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Make a request to `/api/data` (e.g., using your browser or Postman).  Observe the timeout error after several seconds.
5. Try the solution in `dataSolution.js` (you'll need to modify your API route to use it) to see how to address the issue.
